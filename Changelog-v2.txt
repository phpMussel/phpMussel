=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

- [2020.04.13; Maikuolan]: Performed some minor refactoring.

- [2020.04.14; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The phpMussel switch file isn't a signature
  file, but unintentionally matched positive for the phpMussel signature file
  magic number, allowing a very small but real risk that it would be
  interpreted by phpMussel as a signature file, causing PHP errors to be
  generated; Fixed.

- [2020.05.07; Maikuolan]: Some very minor aesthetic improvements.

- [2020.05.16; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved the safety of some included
  hyperlinks by way of including rel tags like noopener, noreferrer, external.
  Added the ability for configuration defaults to define regular expressions
  to be applied to their own values through preg_replace, thus complimenting
  the existing auto-typing functionality (phpMussel won't yet be using this
  functionality for its own configuration defaults, but it is added with the
  intent to provide a mechanism by which plugins may be able to provide
  additional safeguards of their own against bad configuration values).

- [2020.05.28; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The front-end accounts page was incorrectly
  reporting argon2id passwords as invalid; Fixed.

- [2020.06.02; Maikuolan]: Worked on some more minor aesthetic improvements.
  Also added some configuration filters (based on the work done last month) to
  some specific potentially error-prone configuration directives to help reduce
  the risk of erroneous values being specified there.

- [2020.06.03; Maikuolan]: Slightly strengthened the sanity checks performed by
  the front-end updates page when it verifies components.

- [2020.06.07; Maikuolan]: Very slightly improved the logic at the front-end
  updates page for determining whether a component is active or inactive. Also
  made the upload handler uninstallable.

=== Version/Release 2.1.2 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2020.01.01; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The cache handler's PDO query template for
  deleting expired cache entries was malformed; Fixed.

- [2020.01.12; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Found and fixed a small typo in the choice
  filter for the default_algo configuration directive.

- [2020.01.13; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Repair was always failing, specifically for
  just the very first component to appear in any particular components metadata
  file; Fixed.

- [2020.01.25; Maikuolan]: Performed some minor refactoring.

- [2020.02.29; Maikuolan]: Added unit test suite (BDD testing and
  unit testing with Codeception and PHPUnit).
  Refer github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/177

- [2020.03.01; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The number of expected arguments in a call
  to sprintf in the functions file could potentially be manipulated in some
  cases depending on the data supplied to it; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 2.1.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2019.10.23; Maikuolan]: Improved caching mechanism guard code. Deprecated
  and removed the PHP vulnerable version warning formerly displayed at the
  front-end homepage (it risked causing unnecessary alarm for some users,
  especially those unable to update due to hosting restrictions, and posed a
  general annoyance for some other users).

- [2019.11.04; Maikuolan]: Updated the Cache class to use REPLACE INTO instead
  of ON DUPLICATE KEY for SET_QUERY (SQLite and others don't properly support
  the latter). Added the checkTablesPDO method to try to automatically create a
  table for the Cache class instance to use when PDO is enabled.

- [2019.11.04; Maikuolan]: Updated the installed/available extensions list to
  be able to also list which related drivers are installed/available.

- [2019.11.07; Maikuolan]: Performed some aesthetic changes to the front-end
  configuration page, replacing the directive index with a collapsible list,
  added support for category descriptions, and replaced the extensions table
  at the front-end homepage with a collapsible list.

- [2019.12.10; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Undefined variable notice when uninstalling
  components via the front-end updates page; Fixed.

- [2019.12.11; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Internal duplication of component metadata
  at the downstream could sometimes occur in some specific contexts, thereby
  preventing the front-end updates page offering the option to repair the
  affected components; Fixed.

- [2019.12.12; Maikuolan]: Added a "clear all" button to the cache data page.

- [2019.12.12; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The directory traversal detection code was
  unintentionally catching .htaccess files, thereby causing unnecessary forced
  failures on some specific front-end operations; Fixed.

- [2019.12.27; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The cache handler's mechanism for creating
  missing tables in PDO used a malformed query and didn't work properly; Fixed.

- [2019.12.31; Bug-fixes; Maikuolan]: Configuring the supplementary cache
  options in a certain way, due to the way that the front-end updates page
  interacted with the cache handler, could potentially cause the updater to
  perform multiple, superfluous outbound requests during normal operation,
  thereby causing it to lag out and generate server error messages; Fixed.
  Since 2019.12.11, the updater would sometimes fail to correctly detect and
  prepare newly found components from the upstream; Fixed. Also added a new
  mechanism to the codebase to aid with diagnosing bugs in the future (disabled
  by default; not configurable).

=== Version/Release 2.1.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2019.09.04; Maikuolan]: Added *partial* internal language support for
  Latvian, Norwegian, Polish, and Swedish. Will sync it all up with the other
  translations when there's time.

- [2019.09.06; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Found a way to trigger an invalid argument
  warning at the front-end updates page in some contexts; Fixed.

- [2019.09.17; Maikuolan]: Added an events orchestrator and refactored.

- [2019.09.18; Maikuolan]: Added an error handler event to be able to catch and
  report errors more effectively.

- [2019.09.24; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Improved error logging and added a
  default error log handler to take care of error logging in the absence of any
  custom event handlers for error logging. A new configuration directive has
  been added accordingly (error_log). Additionally, all event handlers have
  been moved into their own file, to keep them separated from function/closure
  definitions and to improve maintainability. Some minor refactoring has also
  occurred affecting the aforementioned and calls made to the time formatter.

- [2019.09.26; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Some pre-condition checks weren't being
  processed correctly, causing OLE objects to not be recognised correctly in
  some cases (thanks to Costegillio for bringing this to my attention); Fixed.
  Refer github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/209

- [2019.09.26; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Some of the missing directory guards were
  faulty (thanks to Costegillio for bringing this to my attention); Fixed.
  Refer github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/210

- [2019.09.29; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to automatically
  repair some components via the front-end updates page.

- [2019.10.02; Maikuolan]: Added a new vendor shorthand entry (abuse.ch).

=== Version/Release 2.0.0 ===
MAJOR RELEASE (BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE).

- [2019.05.31; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to automatically
  switch between different channels when requesting a remote resource (e.g.,
  when the front-end updates page attempts to update something, or attempts to
  retrieve the latest available component metadata), for whenever such a
  request fails (e.g., due to server errors, the requested resource no longer
  existing at a particular location, etc), and added a new configuration
  directive, "disabled_channels", to optionally prevent phpMussel from ever
  requesting resources from particular, specific channels.

- [2019.06.17; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to optionally update only all
  signature files to the front-end updates page (as opposed to updating
  everything at once).

- [2019.06.27; Maikuolan]: Shifted responsibility for number formatting out
  from the front-end functions file, into its own, distinct class.

- [2019.07.10; Maikuolan]: The front-end updates page now sets "verify" as the
  default option for components, to help reduce the risk that users select
  "uninstall" or "deactivate" by accident.

- [2019.07.10; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved front-end pie chart colouring.

- [2019.07.26; Maikuolan]: Added condition to ensure that "delete" should never
  be the default option selected for files shown at the front-end file manager.

- [2019.08.05-06; MAJOR CODE CHANGE; Maikuolan]: Removed PHP 5.4 polyfills,
  thereby immediately upping the minimum PHP version requirement for the
  upcoming release. Updated the loader, upping the hardcoded minimum PHP
  version requirement to PHP 7.2, and removed some no longer needed code.
  Removed some extraneous .htaccess files (only really need our main .htaccess
  file in the base of the vault nowadays; the extra .htaccess files in some of
  the vault's subdirectories aren't necessary). Renamed a number of
  configuration directives in order to better comply with the phpMussel code
  style guidelines regarding the use of snake_case for configuration
  directives. Shifted the class autoloader out from the functions file, into
  the main loader. Added PHP7-style type hinting and return type declarations
  wherever applicable. Updated all common classes package classes to the latest
  compatible versions. Added some missing PHPDoc comments.

- [2019.08.17; Maikuolan]: Reinstated the "lang_override" directive.

- [2019.08.23; Maikuolan]: Slightly refactored the front-end updates page,
  related closures and other related functionality, and added the ability to
  install/activate or to deactivate/uninstall with a single action (previously,
  these actions had to be done separately, as two actions). Added some new
  switches/filters.

- [2019.08.24; Maikuolan]: Added last modified date/time to the file listings
  at the front-end file manager and fixed a possible issue with correct icon
  display for some not yet used file formats.

- [2019.08.31; Maikuolan]: Removed some unnecessary code from the loader, left
  over from some old features already removed a long time ago.
