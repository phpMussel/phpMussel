# Warning: When modifying the information in this file, be careful to ensure
# that any changes made won't conflict with the what phpMussel recognises as
# its delimiters or as special characters (newlines, semicolons, colons, etc),
# or else your signature files could break very badly, resulting in an
# inability to properly detect anything, or numerous severe false positives.
# Generally (but not exclusively), "\x0?" (?H0), \x3A, \x3B, and null (\x00)
# should be avoided.
