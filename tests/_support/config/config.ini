; What to do with files that exceed the filesize limit (if one exists). False =
; Whitelist; True = Blacklist [Default].
filesize_response=true

; If your system only allows specific types of files to be uploaded, or if your
; system explicitly denies certain types of files, specifying those filetypes
; in whitelists, blacklists and greylists can increase the speed at which
; scanning is performed by allowing the script to skip over certain filetypes.
; Format is CSV (comma separated values). If you want to scan everything,
; rather than whitelist, blacklist or greylist, leave the variable(/s) blank;
; Doing so will disable whitelist/blacklist/greylist. Logical order of
; processing is: If the filetype is whitelisted, don't scan and don't block the
; file, and don't check the file against the blacklist or the greylist. If the
; filetype is blacklisted, don't scan the file but block it anyway, and don't
; check the file against the greylist. If the greylist is empty or if the
; greylist is not empty and the filetype is greylisted, scan the file as per
; normal and determine whether to block it based on the results of the scan,
; but if the greylist is not empty and the filetype is not greylisted, treat

[compatibility]
; Configuration for compatibility.

; This directive should generally be disabled unless it's required for correct
; functionality of phpMussel on your specific system. Normally, when disabled,
; when phpMussel detects the presence of elements in the $_FILES array(), it'll
; attempt to initiate a scan of the files that those elements represent, and,
; if those elements are blank or empty, phpMussel will return an error message.
; This is proper behaviour for phpMussel. However, for some CMS, empty elements
; in $_FILES can occur as a result of the natural behaviour of those CMS, or
; errors may be reported when there aren't any, in which case, the normal
; behaviour for phpMussel will be interfering with the normal behaviour of
; those CMS. If such a situation occurs for you, enabling this option will
; instruct phpMussel to not attempt to initiate scans for such empty elements,
; ignore them when found and to not return any related error messages, thus
; allowing continuation of the page request. False = OFF; True = ON.
ignore_upload_errors=false

; If you only expect or only intend to allow images to be uploaded to your
; system or CMS, and if you absolutely don't require any files other than
; images to be uploaded to your system or CMS, this directive should be
; enabled, but should otherwise be disabled. If this directive is enabled,
; it'll instruct phpMussel to indiscriminately block any uploads identified as
; non-image files, without scanning them. This may reduce processing time and
; memory usage for attempted uploads of non-image files. False = OFF; True =
; ON.
only_allow_images=false


[heuristic]
; Configuration for heuristic analysis.

; Some phpMussel signatures are intended to identify suspicious and potentially
; malicious indicators in files, without in themselves identifying those files
; as being malicious directly. This "threshold" value tells phpMussel the
; maximum weight allowed before flagging those files as malicious. The
; definition of weight in this context is the total number of suspicious and
; potentially malicious indicators identified. By default, this value will be
; set to 3. A lower value generally will result in a higher occurrence of false
; positives but a higher number of malicious files being flagged, whereas a
; higher value generally will result in a lower occurrence of false positives
; but a lower number of malicious files being flagged. It's generally best to
; leave this value at its default unless you're experiencing problems related
; to it.
threshold=3


[virustotal]
; Configuration for Virus Total integration.

; Optionally, phpMussel is able to scan files using the Virus Total API as a
; way to provide a greatly enhanced level of protection against viruses,
; trojans, malware and other threats. By default, scanning files using the
; Virus Total API is disabled. To enable it, an API key from Virus Total is
; required. Due to the significant benefit that this could provide to you, it's
; something that I highly recommend enabling. Please be aware, however, that to
; use the Virus Total API, you MUST agree to their Terms of Service and you
; MUST adhere to all guidelines as per described by the Virus Total
; documentation! You are NOT permitted to use this integration feature UNLESS:
; You have read and agree to the Terms of Service of Virus Total and its API.
; You have read and you understand, at a minimum, the preamble of the Virus
; Total Public API documentation (everything after "VirusTotal Public API v2.0"
; but before "Contents").
vt_public_api_key=''

; By default, phpMussel will restrict which files it scans using the Virus
; Total API to those files that it considers "suspicious". You can optionally
; adjust this restriction by changing the value of the vt_suspicion_level
; directive.
vt_suspicion_level=1

; Should phpMussel apply the results of scanning using the Virus Total API as
; detections or as detection weighting? This directive exists, because,
; although scanning a file using multiple engines (as Virus Total does) should
; result in an increased detection rate (and therefore in a higher number of
; malicious files being caught), it can also result in a higher number of false
; positives, and therefore, in some circumstances, the results of scanning may
; be better utilised as a confidence score rather than as a definitive
; conclusion. If a value of 0 is used, the results of scanning using the Virus
; Total API will be applied as detections, and therefore, if any engine used by
; Virus Total flags the file being scanned as being malicious, phpMussel will
; consider the file to be malicious. If any other value is used, the results of
; scanning using the Virus Total API will be applied as detection weighting,
; and therefore, the number of engines used by Virus Total that flag the file
; being scanned as being malicious will serve as a confidence score (or
; detection weighting) for whether or not the file being scanned should be
; considered malicious by phpMussel (the value used will represent the minimum
; confidence score or weight required in order to be considered malicious). A
; value of 0 is used by default.
vt_weighting=0

; According to the Virus Total API documentation, "it is limited to at most 4
; requests of any nature in any given 1 minute time frame. If you run a
; honeyclient, honeypot or any other automation that is going to provide
; resources to VirusTotal and not only retrieve reports you are entitled to a
; higher request rate quota". By default, phpMussel will strictly adhere to
; these limitations, but due to the possibility of these rate quotas being
; increased, these two directives are provided as a means for you to instruct
; phpMussel as to what limit it should adhere to. Unless you've been instructed
; to do so, it's not recommended for you to increase these values, but, if
; you've encountered problems relating to reaching your rate quota, decreasing
; these values MAY sometimes help you in dealing with these problems. Your rate
; limit is determined as vt_quota_rate requests of any nature in any given
